Thought Machine is a fintech company that specializes in modernizing banking infrastructure through its core banking platform, Vault. The company was founded in 2014 by Paul Taylor, a former Google engineer. The primary goal of Thought Machine is to move banks away from outdated, legacy systems that are often complex and costly to maintain, to a more modern, efficient, and flexible cloud-based system.

Here are some key aspects of Thought Machine and its offerings:
Core Banking Platform (Vault): Vault is a highly configurable and flexible platform that allows banks to deploy modern banking applications over the cloud. It operates using smart contracts, which define the logic and operations of banking products.
Cloud-Native: Thought Machine's Vault platform is built entirely on cloud technology, making it scalable and resilient. It enables banks to reduce their operational costs and increase their agility in deploying new services.
Smart Contracts: These are used within Vault to handle business logic for various banking functions. This approach allows banks to innovate and customize products more rapidly than traditional core banking systems.
API-Driven: Vault is designed to be API-first, facilitating seamless integration with other financial services and enabling banks to offer a more interconnected service experience to their customers.
International Presence: While based in the UK, Thought Machine has expanded internationally, working with major banks across different continents, helping them to modernize their systems and services.
The company focuses on helping financial institutions to be more agile, secure, and customer-focused by leveraging cloud technology and innovative software architecture.
Core banking engine, Vault Core, was born in the spring of 2015. We've since expanded to more than 500 people across Europe, Asia, North America, Australasia, and the Middle East.
Thought Machine continues its global expansion, winning clients in new territories, including Mexico, Chile, South Korea, Israel, and Guatemala.
Thought Machine is named the best place to work in New York City for the second year running by Crain's and the best place to work by American Banker. Global Finance Magazine names Thought Machine one of the world's most innovative fintechs, and the Financial Times and Statista confirm Thought Machine as one of Europe's fastest-growing companies.

Who is Paul Taylor? Paul Taylor is the founder and CEO of Thought Machine, the leading cloud-native core banking and payments technology provider. Thought Machine is present in 18 countries with a client list of more than a dozen Tier 1 banks worldwide.
Before founding Thought Machine, Paul successfully launched two companies, the second of which was acquired by Google in 2010. At Google, he led the text-to-speech team, which developed cutting-edge technology that is now found in all of Google's navigation and voice search products. Paul holds a PhD in AI and has held teaching positions at Edinburgh and Cambridge Universities. 
Thought Machine is eradicating the outdated legacy technology prevalent in the banking industry. Its next-generation core platform enables banks to migrate away from old systems and launch highly differentiated, modern propositions.
He founded Thought Machine in 2014 because he wanted to bring modern software technology to banking. He strongly felt something needed to be done about the way most banking systems were so cumbersome and awkward, not to mention deeply frustrating and practically useless for millions of end users. 
He is a serial entrepreneur, with expertise in speech, natural language and machine learning.
From 2010-2013 he led the text-to-speech team at Google, developing speech output technology for Google Now, driving directions in Google maps and accessibility. If you hear any Google product speak, that's the system his team built.
He joined Google upon the acquisition of Phonetic Arts, a company he co-founded and was CEO. At Phonetic Arts he developed text-to-speech and other speech technology for the computer games industry. Prior to that he was co-founder and CTO of Rhetorical Systems which was acquired by Nuance in 2004.
He has been an academic at Edinburgh and Cambridge Universities. At Edinburgh he was director of the Centre for Speech Technology Research.

What is the mission of Thought Machine Company? 
Our team’s mission is bold: to create technology that can run the world’s banks according to the best designs and software practices of the modern age. In doing so, we will properly and permanently rid the world’s banks of the problems generated by poor technology running on legacy infrastructure.
This mission inspires our team. What we are attempting is hard, which means we need great people working together towards a common goal.

The main offering of Thought Machine is Vault Core. 
Vault Core’s Universal Product Engine provides unique flexibility and control in the design and build of new financial products by using smart contracts.
Any product can be manufactured, from new innovative products, such as multi-currency accounts or bundled products, to replicating back book products created on legacy platforms.
This enables the safe migration of customers onto Vault Core from legacy platforms without disrupting their existing product set.

Smart contracts
Smart contracts use developer-friendly code to build any financial product. Smart contracts give banks complete control over product logic, providing them with flexibility and power in the design and build of new innovative products and replicating their existing back book.
All financial product creation and changes are abstracted away from the platform via a configuration layer. Any financial product can be built and improved entirely by writing smart contracts – no code in the platform layer is modified, and banks have no reliance on us for product changes.
The logic of a financial product in Vault Core is fully encapsulated, transparent, and described in smart contract code.
Smart contracts are written in developer-friendly code, enabling flexibility of design while exposing common functions via the Contracts API.
Financial logic is executed automatically at account lifecycle events or at specific times through functions called hooks.
Logic is driven by parameters, enabling the creation of highly configurable custom products.
Financial logic can be changed and updated instantly and on demand via API.
Vault Core comes with a full array of financial products already built.
These include market-standard products such as transaction accounts, savings, loans, mortgages, and credit cards. Vault Core supports Islamic banking and innovative products such as buy-now-pay-later, wallets, offset mortgages, and more.
Vault Core is shipped with a suite of base smart contracts as part of our extensive Product Library offering. These smart contracts are ready for launch and can easily be tailored to the bank's specific needs. 
The Product Library currently supports more than 30 countries, and new products are continuously added.

Simulation
Banks can simulate the performance of any financial product before it is launched. Simulation allows banks to see the products' future performance over any period.
The behaviour of a smart contract can be simulated to show its behaviour over its lifetime. This enables a bank to have full confidence in the behaviour of a product before they launch it to customers. This simulation is easily accessible as part of the Core API.
Banks can also enhance their customer experience by enabling customers to simulate the performance of the product they are purchasing. For the first time, every customer can see exactly how every product will behave. There is no further need for error-prone and hard-to-maintain illustration tools.

Real-time Ledger
Vault Core's real-time Ledger gives banks complete control over data management. There is a strict separation between the configuration of smart contracts and the underlying Ledger. We have built Vault Core to support any bank and any product on a single ledger. All data is transmitted in and out of the Ledger in real time, providing rich data streaming for AI and reporting.
The Universal Product Engine and Ledger support a high degree of banking complexity on a single platform instance. This includes multiple banks, multiple currencies, operations teams, branches, business lines and reporting. It can differentiate between ring-fenced and committed funds.
Our Ledger can slice and dice balances into any structure while giving banks unrestricted visibility, enabling powerful and personalised real-time reporting capabilities. Banks can use AI on this data to personalise propositions for customers.
Transactions are processed in real time, with no batch processing. The Ledger is always available and accessible, and the rich data is streamed out via our Streaming API.
Banks can use the Ledger to manage sophisticated lines of funds in any asset or denomination. They can manage anything from international currencies to securities and reward points.
Our Ledger offers a flexible approach to back-book migration, making the process more efficient, faster, and less prone to errors. It also allows for the ingestion of historical customer and ledger data.

Ledger connectivity
Our real-time Ledger is always available and accessible, and the rich data is streamed out via our Streaming API. The Ledger is built to support any bank and any product and has powerful real-time reporting capabilities.

Vault Core APIs
All of Vault Core's functionality and data are exposed through a standard set of APIs enabling unparalleled levels of control and granularity, real-time access to information in the Ledger, and ease of integration with other best-in-class technology vendors.

Hosting options
We are famous for having the best cloud computing expertise in financial services.
We deeply understand best practices in cloud technology and are committed to giving our customers total choice and flexibility as they move to the cloud.
Vault Core was built from scratch as cloud-native technology and can be deployed in the cloud provider of the bank's choice. This enables us to give banks total flexibility to choose the model that best meets their needs.
We are the only truly cloud-native core banking provider that offers any deployment option, including software as a service, bank-hosted in public and private cloud, and hybrid deployment.

SaaS
Our fully managed SaaS deployment of Vault Core removes most of the administration overheads associated with managing cloud infrastructure. Deploying Vault Core as SaaS is a popular choice for agile banks and fintechs.

Bank-hosted
Vault Core can be deployed by the bank in public, private, and hybrid environments.
Public cloud deployments are supported on Azure, AWS, GCP and IBM, and banks can easily add other cloud providers. Hybrid cloud deployments allow sensitive data to remain within a private cloud while the rest of the solution is hosted on a public cloud.
Private cloud deployments are possible using Red Hat OpenShift with AWS Outposts, Azure Stack, or Google Anthos.
